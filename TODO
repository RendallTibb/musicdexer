### Bugs ###

 - Add-to/Change will not update results under all conditions.
 - Japanese characters from tags appear as black diamond question mark characters.
 - No Search formatting, i.e., entering a time of 1:30 would have an undesired result.
 - Formatting for rare cases, e.g., add GB, 3 digit track numbers, hour long songs.
 - Missing paths showing up red might not be best solution for colorblind.

### Tests ###

 - Sync Test: Create an mp3 file and run it through sync successively while changing aspects of file externally. May also create a second file that is similar to the first.
 - Performance Test: Create a test music directory with a large amount of random sub-directories and music files with tag data. Test time of program's sync, search, change, add to.
 Note: These tests have been manually preformed. Need to Create automated versions.
